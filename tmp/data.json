            "explanation": "What's happening with these clouds?  While it may seem that these long and thin clouds are pointing toward the top of a hill, and that maybe a world-famous observatory is located there, only part of that is true. In terms of clouds, the formation is a chance superposition of impressively periodic undulating air currents in Earth's lower atmosphere. Undulatus, a type of Asperitas cloud, form at the peaks where the air is cool enough to cause the condensation of opaque water droplets.  The wide-angle nature of the panorama creates the illusion that the clouds converge over the hill.  In terms of land, there really is a world-famous observatory at the top of that peak: the Carnegie Science's Las Campanas Observatory in the Atacama Desert of Chile.  The two telescope domes visible are the 6.5-meter Magellan Telescopes.  The featured coincidental vista was a surprise but was captured by the phone of a quick-thinking photographer in late September.   Your Sky Surprise: What picture did APOD feature on your birthday?

            "explanation": "What kind of strange galaxy is this? This rare structure is known as a polar ring galaxy, and it seems to have two different rings of stars.  In this galaxy, NGC 660, one ring of bright stars, gas, and dark dust appears nearly vertical, while another similar but shorter ring runs diagonally from the upper left.  How polar ring galaxies obtain their striking appearance remains a topic of research, but a leading theory holds that it is usually the result of two galaxies with different central ring planes colliding.  NGC 660 spans about 50,000 light years and is located about 40 million light years away toward the constellation of the Fish (Pisces).  The featured image was captured recently from Observatorio El Sauce in Chile.",
